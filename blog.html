          <p> UnderDog Devs, founded in September of 2020,
            is a group of software developers supporting the formerly incarcerated &amp; disadvantaged in their
            transition into the software industry.&nbsp; The organization is run entirely by volunteers and has raised
            enough funding to pay their learners a stipend while they learn to code so they can focus 100% of their time
            on learning new skills to achieve a job in tech that will truly transform their lives.<br><br>According to
            data from the <u>U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)</u>, 67.8% of released state prisoners were arrested for a
            new crime within three years, and 76.7% were arrested within five years (Durose, Cooper, &amp; Snyder,
            2014).&nbsp; Reducing

            improves the life quality of individual ex-prisoners.

            Read on to learn about Rick Wolter, founder of UnderDog Devs and how the partnership with Udacity is making
            a difference in the lives of formerly incarcerated and economically disadvantaged individuals
            p>
          <h2><strong>Rick’s story</strong></h2>
          <p>Rick grew up in the Orlando, FL and a lack of parental direction led him to running with the wrong crowd
            and getting in trouble. He eventually ending up in prison when he was 18 years old due to a bad
            choice.&nbsp; Rick used his&nbsp; time in prison to learn about programming and&nbsp;immersed himself in the
            culture through reading and listening to podcasts.<br><br>Upon leaving prison, Rick was able to get into a
            college program and eventually landed a software engineering job.&nbsp; He wanted to help&nbsp;others learn
            how to program and land a job after being released from prison.&nbsp; He created a community with weekly
            meetings, open houses and now they are over 500 members strong.<br><br>Rick reached out to Udacity in August
            2021 asking if Udacity would be willing to support UnderDog Devs by providing Nanodegrees to support 10 of
            his students.&nbsp; <br><br>Many people may be ready to upskill, but lack the time, focus, and resources to
            dedicate the months necessary to be ready to interview for software development roles.&nbsp; They have to
            financially support themselves and their families, while studying and learning.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These impactful “needs” created a program called <a href="https://www.underdogdevs.org/project-underdog"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Underdog</a> where 8-12 mentees are paired with weekly
            mentors to prepare them to secure a software engineering job by the end of the program.&nbsp; They are given
            3-months of financial assistance so they can focus on their goals.</p>
          <h2><strong>Project Underdog Student Success Stories</strong></h2>
          <p>Over 30 students have gone through Project Underdogs and Rick reports back&nbsp; that “nearly everyone who
            took part in our stipend program and enrolled in a Nanodegree was hired, mentioning that they attribute much
            of their success to Udacity.” Here are few of the graduate’s stories.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Richard Dixon – Software Engineer, Corso Systems</strong><br>“I appreciate Udacity so much for
              access to their platform. I took the <a
                href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Full Stack Web Development</a> course dealing with <u>Node</u>, <u>Angular</u> and
              <u>PostgreSQL</u>. I learned a lot and it was very valuable especially with regards to seeing how the backend
              connects to the frontend and knowing about migrations with SQL on the backend as I was only using MongoDB
              before the course.&nbsp; I would definitely advise a course like this for someone looking to get into
              programming.”</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ryan Dayton – Android Developer, Rekor </strong><br>“I’m a felon and construction worker so
              trying to become a software engineer was a daunting task. I really think that if I wasn’t part of Underdog
              Devs and didn’t have access to the resources they provide, like Udacity, I wouldn’t have become an <a
                href="https://www.udacity.com/course/android-basics-nanodegree-by-google--nd803" target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer noopener">Android developer</a>. I was able to go through the Udacity Nanodegree with
              the help of my Underdog Devs mentors plus the ones provided by Udacity. After the Nanodegree I was more
              familiar with the Android platform and was able to use the course projects for my resume. Which was one of
              the reasons I was able to land my first developer role.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Will McQuad – Software Engineer, Pilot</strong><br>Udacity, in combination with support from
              Underdog Devs, has made all the difference. Udacity gave me the structure and quality content that is
              difficult to find. I’ve gone from making no more than 15 dollars an hour doing what I hate to six figures
              doing what I love. I’m a formerly incinerated felon and I really don’t think I could have done it on my
              own. I owe Udacity and Underdog Devs so much. I wanted to change my life and they helped me do just
              that.<br></li>
            <li><strong>Juan Mariscal – iOS Developer,&nbsp; West500</strong> <br>I’ve wanted to learn iOS programming
              for a long time but never could get far by trying by myself with free resources.&nbsp; There’s just too
              much information and you don’t know what is legit. This is where Udacity shined. It has some very well
              done content and a direct path of learning. I was able to learn iOS much faster simply by having content I
              could trust. I would definitely recommend the iOS program at Udacity.&nbsp;<br></li>
            <li><strong>Tavon Gibbs – iOS Intern</strong><br>I did the iOS Nanodegree and absolutely loved it. It really
              helped me by giving awesome feedback on&nbsp; my projects.&nbsp; They made sure I understood the things I
              could improve on. Between that and Underdog Devs I was really set up for success. I received&nbsp; an
              internship with&nbsp; the skills I learned at Udacity and I couldn’t be happier.</li>
